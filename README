=Mind is a Metphor

==Software Requirements
This application requires the following core software:
  * Linux OS (Windows not tested)
  * Ruby 1.86
  * Ruby Gems 1.3.3
  * MySQL or SQLite
  * Java (Sun) 1.5 or later

==Ruby Gems
The application also relies a few Ruby Gems. These can be installed by:
  * opening up a terminal
  * cd <app-dir>
  * running "sudo rake gems:install"

==Database (Migrations)
In order to get the database setup properly, the migration tasks must be executed. This can be accomplished by running the following command:
  * cd <app-dir>
  * running "rake db:migrate"

This creates all of the needed tables for the development environment. To run migrations (or any other rake task) in production mode, append "RAILS_ENV=production" to the previous command.

==Solr
Solr is used for searching data within the public view. To start solr, execute the following:
  cd <app-dir>
  rake solr:start

===Indexing

====Previous App Data Import
To import the existing data (from the old PHP version of this app), execute the following:
  cd <app-dir>
  rake data:import_original

====New Data
New data added/edited/deleted in the admin area of this app will automatically index itself to Solr. If needed, the data in MySQL can be synchronized to Solr by executing the following:
  cd <app-dir>
  rake data:index

==Starting the Rails application
Once Solr has been started, the application can be started by executing the following:
  ./script/server

Now point your browser to http://localhost:3000

==Deploying to Quandu
A Capistrano "recipe" has been setup for basic deployment tasks. To see a list of available commands, execute the following:
  cd <app-dir>
  cap -T

...

==Technical notes
For changing the way the admin search behaves, tweak the code in lib/searchable.rb
More specifically, there is a hash ("condition_mapping") that contains the conditions for each model. Find the search (model) you want to tweak and adjust the conditions accordingly. The conditions are standard ActiveRecord :conditions.
